First this: God created the Heavens and Earth-all you see, all you don't see. 
Earth was a soup of nothingness, a bottomless emptiness, an inky blackness. 
God's Spirit brooded like a bird above the watery abyss.

God spoke: "Light!" And light appeared.
God saw that light was good and separated light form dark.
God named the light Day, he named the dark Night.
It was evening, it was morning-Day one.

God spoke: "Sky! In the middle of the waters; separated water from water!"
God mad sky.
He separated the water under sky from the water above sky.
And there is was: he named sky the Heavens; It was evening, it was morning-Day Two.

9-10 God spoke: "Separate! Water-beneath-Heaven, gather into one place; Land, appear!"
And there it was.
God named the land Earth.
He named the pooled water Ocean.
God saw that it was good.
